Installation For Other Platforms

If you work on Linux or Mac, you can use alternative software for implementing the examples.

For Java, you can download Eclipse by choosing the platform as described in the video.

For C#, you can download MonoDevelop for Linux or Mac. Here is the link:

For C++, you can use Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers. You can use the same steps to download as shown in the lecture "Installation of Eclipse for Java". You only need to choose the correct package and the platform.

Or you may also download Cevelop for C++. It is based on Eclipse, but more geared towards C++ developers.

However, you have to download a compiler separately. I recommend using MingW from mingw.org. Download the installer and choose gcc/g++ compiler.

Cevelop is available as a zip file. Download and unzip it in a directory of your choice and run the Cevelop executable. It will pickup mingw installation directory automatically.

Alternatively, you can use XCode on Mac for C++. XCode can be downloaded directly from Mac Appstore.
